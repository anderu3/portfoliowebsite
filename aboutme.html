    <h1>About me</h1>
    My pronouns are he/him, and I have always loved to tinker with computers, whether that be putting together my own PC, or making random workarounds before discovering the world of programming.

    I have a heavy gaming background and greatly attribute my passion for problem-solving and solution-driven thinking to my years of enjoyment in games.

    Although my programming experience is limited, I have past experience with recognizing problems and implementing solutions. Whether that be through my previous work experience in corporate settings or talking game theory with my cohort, I've always loved drawing flowcharts and identifying problem areas to solve. 

    You can find out more about my professional experience on my <span>resume page</span>, the technologies I've worked with on my <span>skills page</span>, and some of my most recent projects on my <span>Github</span>.
